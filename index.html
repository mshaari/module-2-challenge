                        Hello! My name is Michael Shaari. I am a rising first-year student at Harvard intending to concentrate in Applied Mathematics-Economics with a secondary in Computer Science. I graduated from Horace Mann School in 2022. I am taking a gap year; I work for Macmillan Publishers, tutor in Chemistry, Japanese, and Mathematics, and I am training for a marathon.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In my free time, I like learning how to code, playing with smart home technology, learning about Japanese culture, and watching Netflix.
                    </p>
